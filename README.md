# world-happiness-report

This was a class project for IS 590 Data Visualization. We explored and interactively visualized three years of world happiness reports and uncovered interesting global trends. 

There are two notebooks and a final visualization file. The first notebook explores the data and the different types of visualization, color maps, and design that may suit different variables and data types. The second notebook incldues the polished, interavtive visualizations, the challenges we encountered along the way, and the trends we found in the data. The final product is a informaiton visualization that combines key happiness metrics and visualizations desgined the give an overview of the data. 

We used pandas, numpy, jupyter notebooks, ipywidgets, matplotlib, and bqplot to complete this analysis and create visualizaitons.
