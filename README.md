# world-happiness-report

This was a class project for IS 590 Data Visualization. We explored and interactively visualized from three years of world happiness reports. 

There are two notebooks and a final visualization file. The first notebook explores the data and the different types of visualization, color maps, and design that may suit different variables and data types. The second notebook incldues the polished, interavtive visualizations and the challenges we encountered along the way. The final product is a informaiton visualization that combines key happiness metrics and visualizations desgined the give an overview of the data. 

We used pandas, numpy, and bqplot to complete this analysis and create visualizaitons.
